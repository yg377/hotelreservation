Launcher is the perfect <a href="https://mythemeshop.com/plugins/">WordPress plugin</a> for anyone launching a new product, website or service. Stun visitors with one of our beautiful, ready-made templates or create your own. Build anticipation with timers, contact forms and other promotional features.

= Live Demos =

Create buzz around your product even before you actually launch it. A well-built launch page ensures you are not wasting any traffic that lands on your website before you are ready to show your website/product to the world.

Our plugin also has a nifty opt-in feature to help visitors enter their contact details. You can setup the plugin to add those email subscribers to any one of your favorite email marketing services. Currently, Feedburner, MailChimp, Aweber, Get Response, Campaign Monitor, and Mad Mimi are supported with support for even more services coming soon. This feature alone makes it worth your while to have a launcher page because when you do launch, you already have an audience that is interested in your product and will serve as your "beta testing" sample as well.

With options to change colors and add your own background image - you will be sure that no other launcher page will look like yours.

We have added a simple "enable" button you can use to turn the launch page on or off at any time you like. We know you do not want to keep making the changes every time you disable the plugin, so this small feature will help you retain all the settings for future use.

Launcher plugin is also perfect if you are changing your website's frontend but do not want visitors to see the changes until your website is done with the redesign. With our plugin, your visitors will see the launch/coming soon page while as the users with administrator access will see the regular front-end. This way, you can see the changes live while everyone else sees a "coming soon" page.

While your website is under construction, you can tell the search engines not to index your website with the click of a button.

You can upload a new favicon while the website has a launch page activated and you can add your own title or description to the launch page too.

It is a very light-weight plugin and doesn't add any additional load to your website or your server. It comes with three unique pre-defined templates you can use out-of-the-box or as a base to create a new layout of your own.

Launcher plugin for <a href="https://mythemeshop.com/themes/">WordPress</a> also comes with a frontend editor to make editing the under-construction page a no-brainer. There is a contact form built-in for helping your visitors get in touch with you while the launcher plugin is enabled.

= Developer Zone =
Yes, this plugin is developer friendly and supports **Custom Templates**. You can add templates via the theme or an add-on plugin.
Create a new 'launcher' folder in your theme directory, and add your template files there. The new templates will automatically show up on the Settings page of the Launcher plugin. You can also copy templates from the 'templates' folder of the plugin into your 'launcher' theme folder, but keep in mind that if the file path is the same as that of a default template (e.g. default/default.php), then it will replace the default template instead of adding a new one.
